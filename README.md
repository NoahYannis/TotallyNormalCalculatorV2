## 🚀 About

TotallyNormalCalculator appears to be just a simple calculator at first glance. But after pressing the "." button 4 times in a row, you'll unlock a hidden second app where you can keep a private diary, upload files and browse the internet, all while disguised as a totally normal calculator.

## ✨ Features

- 🧮 **Simple Calculator**: Perform basic calculations.
- 📔 **Secret Diary**: Create, manage, and filter your private diary entries.
- 📂 **File Upload**: Store and access images and videos.
- 🌐 **Web Browsing**: Browse the internet as you wish, hidden behind the calculator interface.
- ⚙️ **Settings**: Select your preferred language and activate dark mode if you like to.
