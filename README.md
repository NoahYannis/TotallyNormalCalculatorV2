# TotallyNormalCalculator

At first glance, this app appears to be a totally normal calculator - just as the title says. 
But after pressing the "." button 4 times, you'll unlock the secret diary that's hidden beneath.
Once unlocked, you can add new entries, read, modify, and delete them as you like. 

I initially developed this before my apprenticeship, this is the second iteration after two years of apprenticeship.

To Do:

- Bugfix
- More Unit Tests
- Add Auto update functionality
- Azure Integration (Blob Storage, Serverless Functions etc)
- Localization
- Save user settings and preferences in database
