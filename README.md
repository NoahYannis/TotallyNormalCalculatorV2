## 🚀 About

TotallyNormalCalculator appears to be just a simple calculator at first glance. But after pressing the "." button 4 times in a row, you'll unlock a hidden second app where you can keep a private diary, upload files and browse the internet, all while disguised as a totally normal calculator.

## ✨ Features

- 🧮 **Simple Calculator**: Perform basic calculations.
- 📔 **Secret Diary**: Create, manage, and filter your private diary entries.
- 📂 **File Upload**: Store and access images and videos.
- 🌐 **Web Browsing**: Browse the internet as you wish, hidden behind the calculator interface.
- ⚙️ **Settings**: Select your preferred language and activate dark mode if you like to.

## 🛠️ How to Install

Download the latest release version from the [releases page](https://github.com/NoahYannis/TotallyNormalCalculatorV2/releases). An internet connection and Windows is required to launch the application.

Disclaimer: The API is hosted on Azure using the free hosting tier. After a prolonged period of inactivity, the API will go idle, which results in longer load times during the initial start-up as it needs to be reactivated.


## 🐞 Bugs

If you encounter any bugs, please check the log files located in your temp directory (e.g., `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Temp\_TotallyNormalCalculator_Logs\tnc.txt` on Windows). After reviewing the logs, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/NoahYannis/TotallyNormalCalculatorV2/issues).
